=== ANTI-FOMO PROTECTION - 3 LAYERS ===

Layer 1: Anti-Pump/Dump (volatilityGuards.ts)
- Blocks BUY when price moves +2% in 1m or +3.5% in 5m
- Blocks SELL when price moves -2% in 1m or -3.5% in 5m

Layer 2: RSI Guards (topGuards.ts - NEW)
- RSI Top: Blocks BUY when RSI > 70 AND near 24h high
- RSI Bottom: Blocks SELL when RSI < 30 AND near 24h low

Layer 3: FOMO/Crowd Guard (topGuards.ts - NEW)
- Blocks BUY when volume spike (z-score > 2.0) AND near 24h high
- Prevents buying during crowd FOMO moments
